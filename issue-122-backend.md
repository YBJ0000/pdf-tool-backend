Summary
Implement PDF generation that merges a PDF form template with the generated PDF form fields definition file introduced in issue-115.

Requirements
- Load the PDF form template.
- Load the PDF form fields definition file.
- Prepare the data for the form fields based on the definition file.
- Merge the form fields data with the PDF template to create a filled PDF form.
- Save the generated PDF form to the desired location.

Design Constraints
- The implementation should reside in a dedicated package.
- Expose a clean, well-designed API for loading templates/definitions, preparing field data, generating the filled PDF, and saving output.
- Follow Spring best practices (clear layering, dependency injection, testable components, and alignment with existing project patterns).

Notes
- In step 3, mock data can be used to populate the form fields for testing purposes.
- This should use the generated form fields definition file from issue-115 plus the corresponding PDF form template.

Acceptance Criteria
- A PDF template can be loaded successfully.
- A generated form fields definition file can be loaded successfully.
- Form field data is prepared according to the definition file schema.
- A filled PDF is generated by merging template + field values.
- The generated PDF is saved to a specified output path.
- The implementation is placed in a dedicated package with a clear API surface suitable for reuse.
- The implementation follows Spring best practices and existing repository conventions.
